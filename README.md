# VIRTUAL PARKING SYSTEM #

This application should be a working prototype of a system that aims to manage a smart park area. Each car parking place is equipped with a parking sensor able to determine if
the place is free or not. The system is *virtual* in the sense that the components (sensors, cars, etc) are not real but are software components that simulate a plausible behavior. The environment where the park area is placed is, for simplicity, a grid-based world, that is an (n x m) matrix where each cell could be a street block or a park place.

# VIRTUAL PARKING SYSTEM #

This application should be a working prototype of a system that aims to manage a smart park area. Each car parking place is equipped with a parking sensor able to determine if
the place is free or not. The system is *virtual* in the sense that the components (sensors, cars, etc) are not real but are software components that simulate a plausible behavior.

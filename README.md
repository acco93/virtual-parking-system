# VIRTUAL PARKING SYSTEM #

## Overview ##
This application should be a working prototype of a system that aims to manage a smart park area.  The system is *virtual* in the sense that the components (sensors, cars, etc) are not real but are software components that simulate a plausible behavior.

## Components ##
The main elements that compose the system are:

* the environment: it is where the park area is placed and everything takes place. It is, for simplicity, a grid-based world, that is an (n x m) matrix where each cell could be a street block or a park place.
* the sensors layer: each car parking place is equipped with a parking sensor able to determine if the place is free or busy.

## System functionalities ##
The main final system should provide the following functionalities:

* find the nearest free park place
* locate the parked car
* ...

The above functionalities should be supported in a client-server interaction schema if the server is available, otherwise using local interactions with near sensors.
